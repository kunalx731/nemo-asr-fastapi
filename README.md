# 🗣️ Nemo-ASR FastAPI for Hindi Speech Recognition

This project provides an API service that transcribes Hindi speech into text using NVIDIA's NeMo toolkit. It leverages a pre-trained speech-to-text model and serves transcriptions through a FastAPI backend. The application supports uploading `.wav` files and returns accurate Hindi transcriptions.

---

## 🧠 Model Information

The system uses the `stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium` model, a medium-sized Conformer CTC model optimized for Hindi speech recognition.

- 🔗 **Source**: [NVIDIA NGC Catalog - NeMo ASR Models](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium)
- 🧰 **Framework**: [NVIDIA NeMo](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo)
- 📤 **Usage**: The model is exported to ONNX using the `model_export.py` script before inference.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Downloaded and used the Hindi ASR model from NVIDIA NeMo.
- Exported the model to ONNX format.
- Built a FastAPI application with `/transcribe` endpoint.
- Implemented input validation (file type, duration).
- Created a lightweight Dockerfile for deployment.

## ⚙️ Local Installation (Without Docker)

You can run the project directly on your machine without using Docker.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalx731/nemo-asr-fastapi.git
cd nemo-asr-fastapi

```

### 2.Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3.Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4.Export the ASR Model to ONNX
This step downloads and converts the NeMo model to ONNX format for optimized inference.
```bash
python model_export.py
```
### 5.Run the FastAPI Server
The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
## 🧪 Testing the API
Use curl to test the transcription endpoint:

```bash

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/transcribe" -F "file=test_file.wav"
```
📌 Ensure the audio is in .wav format, sampled at 16 kHz, and under 10 seconds for best performance.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced
- Async model inference not fully compatible due to blocking nature of NeMo inference.
- Large container image without further optimization.

## 🛠 Limitations & Future Work
- Use TorchScript for async-friendliness.
- Consider multi-stage Docker build for reduced size.
- Enhance inference pipeline with streaming/batching.

## 🔎 Assumptions
- `.wav` files are mono and sampled at 16kHz.
- Audio clips are less than 10 seconds.

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Notes
- Audio must be a `.wav` file at 16kHz, duration 5–10 seconds.
- This project uses the `stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium` model from NVIDIA NGC.
